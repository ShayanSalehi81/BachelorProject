The goal is to have a binary classifier that, by receiving any input text, determines its class in the output. The classes include two categories: 'not important' and 'important', meaning social news type '0' and social news type '1'.

Task description:

We label a social news text as '1' if it is of high importance to most Persian-speaking users. In other words, if a large population of Iranians are likely to read, share, or be interested in it, it is classified as '1'.

If the social news pertains to a small group or a specific community of users, has little reading value, or is not significant, it is classified as '0'.

If the input text is of type '1', the output class will be '1'; if it is '0', the output class will be '0'.

Some concepts that fall under social news type '1' are:
News about significant social movements or protests within Iran.
Changes in laws or regulations that impact daily life, such as those related to education, employment, or public services.
News involving prominent Iranian social figures, celebrities, or influential personalities who are widely recognized.
Social issues like poverty, inequality, or social justice matters that resonate widely within the Iranian society.

Learn from the above examples and determine the output (only '1' or '0').

Now, based on the "above examples," respond with only a single word that, considering the concepts discussed above and your own inferential ability, indicates whether the following text should be classified as '1' or '0'. ('1' or '0'):

You are only allowed to write the label '1' or '0' in the output, without any additional explanation.
