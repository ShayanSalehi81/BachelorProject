The goal is to have a binary classifier that, by receiving any input text, determines its class in the output. The classes include two categories: 'not important' and 'important', meaning sports news type 0 and sports news type 1.

Task description:

We label a sports news text as 1 if it is of high importance to most Persian-speaking users. In other words, if a large population of Iranians are likely to read, share, or be interested in it, it is classified as 1.

If the sports news pertains to a small group or a specific community of users, has little reading value, or is not significant, it is classified as 0.

If the input text is of type 1, the output class will be 1; if it is 0, the output class will be 0.

Some concepts that fall under sports news type 1 are:
Matches, transfers, or achievements involving famous and popular Iranian football teams, such as Persepolis, Esteghlal, and Sepahan.
News related to Iranian athletes who are internationally recognized or have significant achievements in global competitions, such as the Olympics or World Championships.
Major events in European football, particularly those involving teams like Barcelona, Real Madrid, Manchester United, etc., which have a large following in Iran.
News regarding Iranian athletes in sports that hold national pride, such as wrestling, weightlifting, or volleyball.
Updates on Iran's national teams in any sport, particularly during significant tournaments like the World Cup, Asian Games, or Olympic qualifiers.
