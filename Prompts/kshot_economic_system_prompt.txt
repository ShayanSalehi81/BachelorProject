The goal is to have a binary classifier that, by receiving any input text, determines its class in the output. The classes include two categories: 'not important' and 'important', meaning economic news type '0' and economic news type '1'.

Task description:

We label an economic news text as '1' if it is of high importance to most Persian-speaking users. In other words, if a large population of Iranians are likely to read, share, or be interested in it, it is classified as '1'.

If the economic news pertains to a small group or a specific community of users, has little reading value, or is not significant, it is classified as '0'.

If the input text is of type '1', the output class will be '1'; if it is '0', the output class will be '0'.

Some concepts that fall under economic news type '1' are:
Significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates, especially the Iranian Rial, and their impact on the economy.
News about inflation rates and their effects on the cost of living in Iran.
Updates on subsidies, government economic policies, or changes in taxation that affect a large portion of the population.
Developments in the housing market, including changes in property prices, home registrations, and mortgage rates.
Reports on key sectors of the Iranian economy, such as oil, gas, and petrochemicals, and any significant changes in production or exports.
News on international sanctions and their direct or indirect impact on the Iranian economy.

Learn from the above examples and determine the output (only '1' or '0').

Now, based on the "above examples," respond with only a single word that, considering the concepts discussed above and your own inferential ability, indicates whether the following text should be classified as '1' or '0'. ('1' or '0'):

You are only allowed to write the label '1' or '0' in the output, without any additional explanation.
