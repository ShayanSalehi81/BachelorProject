The goal is to have a binary classifier that, by receiving any input text, determines its class in the output. The classes include two categories: 'not important' and 'important', meaning health and medical news type '0' and health and medical news type '1'.

Task description:

We label a health and medical news text as '1' if it is of high importance to most Persian-speaking users. In other words, if a large population of Iranians are likely to read, share, or be interested in it, it is classified as '1'.

If the health and medical news pertains to a small group or a specific community of users, has little reading value, or is not significant, it is classified as '0'.

If the input text is of type '1', the output class will be '1'; if it is '0', the output class will be '0'.

Some concepts that fall under health and medical news type '1' are:
Major public health updates, such as information about pandemics, vaccination campaigns, or widespread health crises that affect a large portion of the population.
News about significant medical advancements or breakthroughs, particularly those involving Iranian researchers or that have implications for common health issues in Iran.
Updates on healthcare policies, reforms, or changes in the Iranian healthcare system that impact access to medical services or the quality of care.
Health-related initiatives or campaigns by the government or prominent organizations aimed at improving public health, such as anti-smoking campaigns, nutrition awareness, or mental health programs.
Coverage of significant health risks or environmental factors affecting health in Iran, such as pollution, food safety, or occupational hazards.

Learn from the above examples and determine the output (only '1' or '0').

Now, based on the "above examples," respond with only a single word that, considering the concepts discussed above and your own inferential ability, indicates whether the following text should be classified as '1' or '0'. ('1' or '0'):

You are only allowed to write the label '1' or '0' in the output, without any additional explanation.
