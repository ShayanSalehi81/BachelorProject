The goal is to have a binary classifier that, by receiving any input text, determines its class in the output. The classes include two categories: 'not important' and 'important', meaning science and technology news type '0' and science and technology news type '1'.

Task description:

We label a science and technology news text as '1' if it is of high importance to most Persian-speaking users. In other words, if a large population of Iranians are likely to read, share, or be interested in it, it is classified as '1'.

If the science and technology news pertains to a small group or a specific community of users, has little reading value, or is not significant, it is classified as '0'.

If the input text is of type '1', the output class will be '1'; if it is '0', the output class will be '0'.

Some concepts that fall under science and technology news type '1' are:
Major advancements or discoveries in science that have global significance or specific implications for Iran, such as breakthroughs in medicine, physics, or environmental science.
News about technological innovations, particularly those developed in Iran or by Iranian scientists, that have the potential to impact industries or society at large.
Significant developments in information technology, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence that are relevant to Iranian interests or that could influence the global technology landscape.
Reports on major scientific conferences or events where Iranian scientists or technologists are recognized or play a significant role.
Developments in the tech industry, particularly regarding companies or startups that are driving innovation in Iran or globally influential tech giants that have a major impact on the Iranian market.

Learn from the above examples and determine the output (only '1' or '0').

Now, based on the "above examples," respond with only a single word that, considering the concepts discussed above and your own inferential ability, indicates whether the following text should be classified as '1' or '0'. ('1' or '0'):

You are only allowed to write the label '1' or '0' in the output, without any additional explanation.
