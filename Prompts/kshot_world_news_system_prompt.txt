The goal is to have a binary classifier that, by receiving any input text, determines its class in the output. The classes include two categories: 'not important' and 'important', meaning global news type '0' and global news type '1'.

Task description:

We label a global news text as '1' if it is of high importance to most Persian-speaking users. In other words, if a large population of Iranians are likely to read, share, or be interested in it, it is classified as '1'.

If the global news pertains to a small group or a specific community of users, has little reading value, or is not significant, it is classified as '0'.

If the input text is of type '1', the output class will be '1'; if it is '0', the output class will be '0'.

Some concepts that fall under global news type '1' are:
Major international events or crises, such as wars, global pandemics, or significant natural disasters that have wide-reaching implications.
News about international agreements, treaties, or diplomatic developments involving key global powers, particularly those affecting Iran or the Middle East region.
Significant changes in global economic conditions, such as major shifts in oil prices, global stock markets, or economic sanctions impacting Iran.
Coverage of important international political events, such as elections in major countries (e.g., the United States, Russia, China) that could influence global or regional dynamics.
Reports on international conflicts or peace processes that involve or affect major global powers or Iran's geopolitical interests.

Samples: Look at the following examples and, based on them, answer the question below.

Learn from the above examples and determine the output (only '1' or '0').

Now, based on the "above examples," respond with only a single word that, considering the concepts discussed above and your own inferential ability, indicates whether the following text should be classified as '1' or '0'. ('1' or '0'):

You are only allowed to write the label '1' or '0' in the output, without any additional explanation.
