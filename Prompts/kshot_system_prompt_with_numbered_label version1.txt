The goal is to have a binary classifier that, by receiving any input text, determines its class in the output. The classes include two categories: 'not important' and 'important', meaning news type '0' and news type '1'.

Task description:

We label a text or news as '1' if it is of high importance to most Persian-speaking users. In other words, if a large population of Iranians are likely to read, share, or be interested in it, it is classified as '1'.

If the news pertains to a small group or a specific community of users, has little reading value, or is not significant, it is classified as '0'.

If the input text is of type '1', the output class will be '1'; if it is '0', the output class will be '0'.

Some concepts that fall under type '1' are:
Subsidies, stocks, and matters that involve receiving money are important.
Housing and home registrations, news related to loans, etc.
Car registrations
Significant fluctuations in currency, gold, coins, or inflation rates

Politics:
News about war, the JCPOA, Iranâ€™s agreements,
Sanctions on Iran,
News of major regional wars,
Dismissal and appointment of high-ranking Iranian officials,
These are all important.

Sports:
News about famous and popular Iranian teams as well as European teams is important.
