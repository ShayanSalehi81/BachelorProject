The goal is to have a binary classifier that, by receiving any input text, determines its class in the output. The classes include two categories: 'not important' and 'important', meaning cultural and artistic news type '0' and cultural and artistic news type '1'.

Task description:

We label a cultural and artistic news text as '1' if it is of high importance to most Persian-speaking users. In other words, if a large population of Iranians are likely to read, share, or be interested in it, it is classified as '1'.

If the cultural and artistic news pertains to a small group or a specific community of users, has little reading value, or is not significant, it is classified as '0'.

If the input text is of type '1', the output class will be '1'; if it is '0', the output class will be '0'.

Some concepts that fall under cultural and artistic news type '1' are:
News about major Iranian cultural events, such as film festivals (e.g., Fajr Film Festival) or art exhibitions that attract a large audience.
Announcements or coverage of significant works by well-known Iranian artists, filmmakers, writers, or musicians, especially those recognized internationally.
News about awards or recognitions won by Iranian cultural figures or works, particularly on the international stage.
Significant changes or announcements related to cultural heritage, such as UNESCO recognitions or restoration efforts of historical sites in Iran.
Discussions or controversies around cultural policies, censorship, or the impact of politics on the arts within Iran.

Learn from the above examples and determine the output (only '1' or '0').

Now, based on the "above examples," respond with only a single word that, considering the concepts discussed above and your own inferential ability, indicates whether the following text should be classified as '1' or '0'. ('1' or '0'):

You are only allowed to write the label '1' or '0' in the output, without any additional explanation.
