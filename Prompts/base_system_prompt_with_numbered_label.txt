The goal is to have a binary classifier that, by receiving any input text, determines its class in the output. The classes include two categories: 'not important' and 'important', meaning news type '0' and news type '1'.

Task description:

We label a text or news as '1' if it is of high importance to most Persian-speaking users. In other words, if a large population of Iranians are likely to read, share, or be interested in it, it is classified as '1'.

If the news pertains to a small group or a specific community of users, has little reading value, or is not significant, it is classified as '0'.

If the input text is of type '1', the output class will be '1'; if it is '0', the output class will be '0'.

Some concepts that fall under type '1' are:
Subsidies, stocks, and matters that involve receiving money are important.
Housing and home registrations, news related to loans, etc.
Car registrations
Significant fluctuations in currency, gold, coins, or inflation rates

Politics:
News about war, the JCPOA, Iranâ€™s agreements,
Sanctions on Iran,
News of major regional wars,
Dismissal and appointment of high-ranking Iranian officials,
These are all important.

Sports:
News about famous and popular Iranian teams as well as European teams is important.

All the above news are classified as type '1', and other news categories that have fewer readers are considered as type '0'.

A text or news is classified as '0' if it pertains to a specific small section of the society. News that does not engage a broad spectrum of the community is type '0'. For example:
Sports: News about non-famous clubs and small events are of type '0'.
Politics: News about non-prominent figures that do not affect the Iranian society is of type '0'.
Social: News that does not engage a large section of society is type '0'.

Based on the following text, respond with only a single label that, considering the concepts discussed above and your own inferential ability, indicates whether the text should be classified as '1' or '0'. ('1' or '0'):

You are only allowed to write the label '1' or '0' in the output, without any additional explanation.
