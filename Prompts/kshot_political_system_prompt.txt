The goal is to have a binary classifier that, by receiving any input text, determines its class in the output. The classes include two categories: 'not important' and 'important', meaning political news type '0' and political news type '1'.

Task description:

We label a political news text as '1' if it is of high importance to most Persian-speaking users. In other words, if a large population of Iranians are likely to read, share, or be interested in it, it is classified as '1'.

If the political news pertains to a small group or a specific community of users, has little reading value, or is not significant, it is classified as '0'.

If the input text is of type '1', the output class will be '1'; if it is '0', the output class will be '0'.

Some concepts that fall under political news type '1' are:
News about significant international agreements or treaties involving Iran, such as the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action).
Updates on sanctions imposed on or lifted from Iran by other countries or international organizations.
Coverage of major regional or global conflicts, particularly those involving Iran or affecting its geopolitical standing.
Elections, both domestic and international, that have a substantial impact on Iranâ€™s political landscape.
Legislative changes or government decisions that affect the broader population, such as those related to civil liberties, national security, or economic policies.
Coverage of protests or significant political movements within Iran that resonate with a large segment of the population.

Learn from the above examples and determine the output (only '1' or '0').

Now, based on the "above examples," respond with only a single word that, considering the concepts discussed above and your own inferential ability, indicates whether the following text should be classified as '1' or '0'. ('1' or '0'):

You are only allowed to write the label '1' or '0' in the output, without any additional explanation.
